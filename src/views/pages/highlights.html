					As China's symbol world-wide like the&nbsp;Great Wall or&nbsp;the&nbsp;Temple&nbsp;of&nbsp;Heaven, the&nbsp;Forbidden City (called "Gu Gong", "故宫"in&nbsp;Chinese, literally meaning "Old Palace") is&nbsp;the&nbsp;most important masterpiece of&nbsp;Chinese history and&nbsp;culture. This&nbsp; real Imperial Palace Museum was for&nbsp;centuries the&nbsp;imperial place for&nbsp;24 emperors starting from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ming Dynasty (1368&nbsp;–&nbsp;1644). Believed as&nbsp;Sons of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Heaven, emperors and&nbsp;their families were the&nbsp;only ones allowed to&nbsp;enter the&nbsp;place as the&nbsp;complex had been created according to&nbsp;ancient Chinese astronomy establishing that&nbsp;emperors should live at the&nbsp;center of&nbsp;Heaven: the&nbsp;"Purple Star" (Polaris). Called the&nbsp;"Purple Forbidden City" in&nbsp;ancient times the&nbsp;site took naturally its name of&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Forbidden City" for&nbsp;ordinary people were not allowed to&nbsp;enter such a&nbsp;divine place. the&nbsp;Forbidden City is&nbsp;the&nbsp;perfect place where some millions of&nbsp;preserved historical relics have been collected, displayed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;site that&nbsp;has kept its original splendid architecture for&nbsp;the&nbsp;pleasure of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;tourists visiting the&nbsp;old city every year.

				<p class="justify text-cols--2 u-margin-bottom-large">
					Together with its awe-inspiring architecture comes the&nbsp;impressive historical richness hiding behind the&nbsp;walls of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Forbidden City. During over 5 centuries, the&nbsp;Imperial Forbidden City has been home to&nbsp;24 Emperors: 14 during the&nbsp;Ming Dynasty (1368&nbsp;–&nbsp;1644) and&nbsp;10 during the&nbsp;Qing Dynasty (1644–1911). This&nbsp; was in&nbsp;1406 that&nbsp;the&nbsp;construction&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;"Emperor's Palace" started under the&nbsp;request of&nbsp;Emperor Yongle (Ming Dynasty). During 14 years, million&nbsp;of&nbsp;workers and&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;artisans worked hard in&nbsp;the&nbsp;conception&nbsp;of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;building. the&nbsp;stone used in&nbsp;the&nbsp;construction&nbsp;were the&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;nearby Mount Fang (房山Fang Shan) that&nbsp;were carried pieces after pieces to&nbsp;the&nbsp;city. This&nbsp; is&nbsp;even said that&nbsp;some bricks were made from&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination&nbsp;of&nbsp;white lime and&nbsp;glutinous rice!

					As incredible as it can&nbsp;be, these materials ended to&nbsp;be particularly strong for&nbsp;there are&nbsp;still standing today in&nbsp;the&nbsp;capital. Finished in&nbsp;1420, the&nbsp;Forbidden City started to&nbsp;become the&nbsp;headquarter of&nbsp;China&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;capital city of&nbsp;the&nbsp;country moved there from&nbsp;Nanjing. Wartimes, historical events and&nbsp;dynasties' shifts made hard damages to&nbsp;the&nbsp;holly city that&nbsp;was burnt down, rebuilt, sacked and&nbsp;renovated a&nbsp;countless of&nbsp;times. Thus, most of&nbsp;the&nbsp;architecture which can&nbsp;be admired today by tourists traces back to&nbsp;the&nbsp;1700s onwards. Previously being a&nbsp;site where only emperors were authorized to&nbsp;reside with their imperial family and&nbsp;concubines, the&nbsp;fall of&nbsp;the&nbsp;last emperor of&nbsp;China&nbsp;in&nbsp;1912 changed the&nbsp;destiny of&nbsp;the&nbsp;city that&nbsp;started to&nbsp;be opened to&nbsp;public and&nbsp;tourists. Recognized by the&nbsp;Chinese central government in&nbsp;1961 for&nbsp;its important role in&nbsp;China's history, the&nbsp;Forbidden City became progressively a&nbsp;major tourist attraction. the&nbsp;nomination&nbsp;to&nbsp;UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in&nbsp;1987 paid a&nbsp;large tribute to&nbsp;This&nbsp; ancient Chinese and&nbsp;human&nbsp;masterpiece that&nbsp;has succeeded in&nbsp;resisting Dynasties, wars, modern times and&nbsp;tourists' continuous visits.

					Representing the&nbsp;world's largest complex still preserved from&nbsp;human&nbsp;activity, the&nbsp;Forbidden City is&nbsp;a&nbsp;jewel of&nbsp;China's history and&nbsp;culture, representing the&nbsp;Emperor's supreme power given from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Heaven. Being the&nbsp;center of&nbsp;China&nbsp;for&nbsp;centuries, the&nbsp;Forbidden City's architecture was not left to&nbsp;chance as This&nbsp; was supposed to&nbsp;represent the&nbsp;city in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Heaven. the&nbsp;rectangular complex covers an&nbsp;area&nbsp;of&nbsp;74 hectares (183 acres) and&nbsp;over 150,000&nbsp;square&nbsp;meters&nbsp;(1,600,000 square&nbsp;feet).

Some particularities of&nbsp;the&nbsp;City are&nbsp;the&nbsp;typical yellow roofs that&nbsp;symbolizes in&nbsp;China&nbsp;the&nbsp;Royal Family hence its predominance all over the&nbsp;site except for&nbsp;one building that&nbsp;displays a&nbsp;black colored roof. Called Pavilion&nbsp;of&nbsp;Literary Profundity (文渊阁Wen Yuan&nbsp;Ge), the&nbsp;building is&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact the&nbsp;Royal Library: the&nbsp;black color in&nbsp;ancient Chinese symbolism was supposed to&nbsp;represent water, thus extinguishing any possible fire in&nbsp;the&nbsp;building. By visiting the&nbsp;Forbidden City, no one can&nbsp;deny the&nbsp;considerable skills that&nbsp;artisans and&nbsp;workers had already during ancient times in&nbsp;building outstanding and&nbsp;large-scale places. Indeed, as grandiose as it stands, the&nbsp;Forbidden City is&nbsp;today listed as one of&nbsp;the&nbsp;five most important palaces in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world (together with the&nbsp;Palace of&nbsp;Versailles of&nbsp;France, Buckingham Palace of&nbsp;UK, the&nbsp;White House of&nbsp;USa&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;Kremlin&nbsp;of&nbsp;Russia).

Events were indeed usually held in&nbsp;that&nbsp;hall. Finally, the&nbsp;Hall of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Preserving Harmony was the&nbsp;building used for&nbsp;holding banquets and&nbsp;imperial examinations. Standing straight out of&nbsp;that&nbsp;building, the&nbsp;Gate of&nbsp;Heavenly Peace (乾清门Qian&nbsp;Qing Men) is&nbsp;welcoming visitors as it is&nbsp;the&nbsp;main&nbsp;gateway to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Inner Court of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Forbidden City.</span>

				<p class="justify text-cols--2 u-margin-bottom">
					<span style="display: inline-block;">Beside them, 12 more palaces stand: 6 on&nbsp;the&nbsp;eastern side, 6 on&nbsp;the&nbsp;western side. These were the&nbsp;residences of&nbsp;the&nbsp;emperors' concubines converted today into&nbsp;exhibition&nbsp;halls.</span>
